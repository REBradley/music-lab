{- What I'm Building: 
 - Â© I need to build up a system of describing the concept of bars and time signatures.
 - I need to have a way of describing one player's Score for a song (e.g. a
 - player for hihats)
 - I need a way to Compose Scores.
 -
 - Analogy: 
 - Lines        are Transposed Vectors
 - Bars         are Vectors
 - Compositions are Matrices
 -
 - You can apply a transformation (n x 1 vector) to an mxn-bar-wide composition
 - [1
 -  0
 -  0
 -  1] Select out the ith bar in all lines
 -
 - What's The Interface:
 - TimeSig = [Dur]
 -
 - Percussion :: TimeSig -> [[Dur]] -> Music a
 - NoteInst :: TimeSig -> [[Dur]] -> [Pitch] -> Music a
 -
 - TimeSig -> PlayerScore
 - [PlayerScore] -> Composition
 -
 - Why I'm Building It: Trying to manipulate musical values within a song is
 - difficult. This is because before this module, a song would be one long
 - sequence of Music values using ":=:" and ":+:" on sections of a song,
 - without some way to specify a particular player's "score" and bar
 - interval within that score. I need a "song" to have a better way of being
 - constructed and manipulated. Thus, bars can be manipulated themselves within
 - a score, all bars of a song going vertically can be manipulated to affect all
 - scores, and certain subsets going horizontally can be manipulated. I need a
 - higher level overview on how to specify songs.

{- Things to Know:
 - PercussionSound is required in order to turn durations into Music Values.
 - This is done through (perc :: PercussionSound -> Dur -> Music Pitch).
